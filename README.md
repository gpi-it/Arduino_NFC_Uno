# Arduino_NFC_Uno
Proof on concept for Arduino NFC system

scans for tags and returns their ID number, if tag matchs number stored will activate the motor for one second.

Basically tidy up the wiring and attach a relay to a solenoid lock, and add some security and you have an NFC controlled door lock.

TODO: Add Yun support for database read/writing over network.
